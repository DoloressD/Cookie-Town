# Cookie Town


Hello and welcome to an example project of my City Building game. I am just using this as a practice project!

Here I am using Unity 2018.4.36f1 as well as some preview packages.

My focus on this project is Implementing design patterns and tools that I have not had the opportunity to use during my professional experience, which involves a lot of short deadlines and sacrifices with coding standards.

Here they are Unity Test for EditMode and PlayMode, State Patterns, Scriptable Objects, A lot of refactoring (maybe a bit excessive), and many more things to learn and implement.

Currently the relevent scene is the BuildingMechanicPrototype and the SampleScene is just a level design laid out.

#How to play
Click on the "Build" Button, that will open up the build Menu, once you choose a building type, click on the grid and a block will be placed. Demolish Button allows you to delete the block and there is a cancel button to close the build Menu. Hold right click outside of building mode to pan.
