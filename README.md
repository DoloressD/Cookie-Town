# Cookie Town


Hello and welcome to an example project of my City Building game. I am just using this as a practice project!

Here I am using Unity 2018.4.36f1 as well as some preview packages.

My focus on this project is Implementing design patterns and tools that I have not had the opportunity to use during my professional experience, which involves a lot of short deadlines and sacrifices with coding standards.

Here they are Unity Test for EditMode and PlayMode, State Patterns, A lot of refactoring (maybe a bit excessive), and many more things to learn and implement.

Currently the relevent scene is the BuildingMechanicPrototype and the SampleScene is just a level design laid out
